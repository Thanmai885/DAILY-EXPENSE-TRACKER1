JAVA PROGRAMMING INTERNSHIP PROJECT 1

Project Title: Daily Expense Tracker

Project Overview

The Daily Expense Tracker is a practical and user-friendly tool designed to help users manage their finances efficiently. The project allows users to log daily expenses, categorize them (e.g., food, travel, utilities), and view summarized reports for specific time periods such as a day, week, or month. The application also stores all data in a text file, ensuring that users can retrieve and review their expense history at any time.

This project introduces real-world applications of programming concepts and is an excellent stepping stone toward building more advanced applications.

Key Features of the Project

1. Add Expenses: Users can log expenses by specifying the amount, category, and a short description.

2. View Summaries: The application can display:

- Total expenses for the day.

- Total expenses for the week.

- Total expenses for the month.

3. Save Data: All expense records are stored in a text file for future reference.

4. Concepts Covered:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Design classes like Expense and ExpenseManager to encapsulate data and logic.

- File Handling: Use Java's file I/O to store and retrieve expense data.

-Basic Loops and User Input: Implement loops for iterative operations and handle user input seamlessly.

Tips for Success

1. Plan Your Code Structure: Identify the necessary classes, methods, and their interactions before starting the implementation. Suggested classes include:

Expense for storing details of individual expenses.

Expense Manager for managing and processing all expenses.

2. Start Simple: Begin by implementing basic functionalities like adding an expense and displaying all expenses before moving to advanced features like summaries and file handling.

3. Test Incrementally: Test each feature as you implement it to ensure smooth functionality and identify

bugs early.

4. Organize Your Code: Use clear, meaningful variable and method names for readability and maintainability.
